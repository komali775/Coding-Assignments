#1. Define a static variable and access that through a class  

class A:
    x = 91  

print(A.x)  

#2. Define a static variable and access that through a instance 

class A:
    static_var = 78  
x = A()
print(x.static_var)

#3. Define a static variable and change within the instance 

class A:
    x = 64  
A.x = 87
print(A.x)

#4. Define a static variable and change within the class

class A:
    x = 85  
obj = A()
obj.x = 97  

print("Class variable:",A.x) 
print("Instance variable:",obj.x)
