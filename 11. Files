#1. Write a program to read text file 

file = open("sample.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
print(content)

''' sample.txt file
Hello, this is a simple text file.
Python makes file handling easy!
'''
#2. Write a program to write text to .txt file using  InputStream 

file = open("output.txt", "w")  
file.write(input("Enter text: "))  
file.close()  
print("Text written to output.txt")

#3. Write a program to read a file stream 

file = open("sample.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()

#4. Write a program to read a file stream supports random access 

with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()  

print(lines[0].strip()) 
print(lines[1].strip())

print(lines[0][:5]) 

#5. Write a program to read a file a just to a particular index using seek() 

with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    index = int(input()) 
    file.seek(index)  
    content = file.read() 
    print(content)

#6. Write a program to check whether a file is having read access and write access permissions

import os

filename = "sample.txt"

if os.access(filename, os.R_OK):
    print(f"'{filename}' has read access.")
else:
    print(f"'{filename}' does NOT have read access.")

if os.access(filename, os.W_OK):
    print(f"'{filename}' has write access.")
else:
    print(f"'{filename}' does NOT have write access.")
